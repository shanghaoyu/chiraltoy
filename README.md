# Chiral Nuclear Force Factory

This is a **Chiral Nuclear Force Factory**, a computational framework designed for performing a wide range of nuclear physics calculations, including:

- Nucleon-nucleon phase shifts  
- Scattering cross sections  
- Short-range correlations (SRC)  
- Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) evolution  
- Deuteron properties (including coordinate-space solutions)  

## Dependencies

> ⚠️ **Important**: The required `deps` folder is **not included** in this repository.

The `deps` folder contains source files for various chiral nuclear force models. These files are not provided here because they were not written by me and require the original author's permission for redistribution.

If you need access to these files, please contact me directly at **shy@stu.pku.edu.cn**.

## Credits

The original framework was developed by **Andreas Ekström**.  
The following components were added or significantly extended by me (**Haoyu Shang**) and **Rongzhe Hu**:

- Cross section calculations  
- Short-range correlation analysis  
- SRG evolution implementation  
- Coordinate-space solutions for deuteron properties
